        <p>This data is taken from the
          <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I believe the responses of users on Stack Overflow is reflective of coders in general.</p>
        <p>I decided to present these charts because of my reactions to the results.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>The Gender of All Respondents</h2>
      <div class="chart">
        <p>Male</p>
        <div class="male stat"></div>
        <p>Female</p>
        <div class="female stat"></div>
        <p>Non-binary</p>
        <div class="non-binary stat"></div>
      </div>

        <p>
          I chose to present this chart because I was surprised by the 
          low percentage of females on Stack Overflow. I expected a greater 
          percentage of females that was closer to 10%. 2018's Developer Survey
          reported 6.9% female users. The percentage increased by a whole point,
          which is an improvement. I hope more women become involved in
          coding and use Stack Overflow.

      <h2>Feelings of Competency by Gender</h2> 
      <div id="competency-chart" class="chart">
        <p>Male</p>
        <div class="male-comp stat"></div>
        <p>Non-binary</p>
        <div class="nonb-comp stat"></div>
        <p>Female</p>
        <div class="female-comp stat"></div>
      </div>
      <figcaption>
        <p>
            I chose to present this chart because I was surprised by 
            fact that females have the lowest feelings of competency,
            over ten percentage lower than males. Personally,
            I believe the idea that women enter companies easier
            because they are women is responsible for females' lower 
            feelings of competency. Whether that be true or false,
            I hope we all make changes to empower women.
